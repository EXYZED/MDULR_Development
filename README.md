# SITREP, What is it?
'Sitrep' defined as the *current military situation at a particular area*. Is a development project open to experienced members of the public in creating a military real-time strategy game, which surprisingly isn't a cliché first person shooter. Our schematics are based of another similar game called 'Tom Clancy's End-War' and aiming to make a game which doesn't 'feel' like a typical ROBLOX game.  The current development team have a nice foundation on what should be done.

## Development inside MDULR
MDULR (Development group) holds the development processes and faculties of SITREP,  And are currently looking out for experienced developers who are consistent and organized. We currently organise our assignments and issues via a GitHub medium

https://github.com/EXYZED/MDULR_Development/projects/1

Since the team is expanding, we need developers to have a nice coherent professional relationship with the developer themselves, therefore this criteria is provided that you should vocally communicate between yourself and the team, this can be organised in order to get tasks done quickly as possible. We'll introduce you to the mechanics and the structure of the game should you join the team.

SITREP's development window suggests that the project is completed within 1-2 years (or earlier) if developers work at standards.

## Criteria
As much as the team hates setting criteria. We did this so that we could ensure that developers are suited to the task and are provided work beyond their experience. So we set a basic checklist that you need to follow to see if you can partake in the development process:

1. Two years of experience related to a particular field required in developing the game.
2. Willingness to contribute actively and consistently within the team.
3. Free of stress. (we want you to focus on any issues you may have in life before joining us, developing can sometimes be boring and stressful)
4. Organised, you're able to organise yourself and integrate yourself within the team to work effectively.
5. Able to create a GitHub account.
6. Knowledge of Markdown
7. A efficient mindset.
8. Mutual respect between developers. Leaking is unethical.

#### Workload
The development group is mentally co-ordinated towards GMT time (UK time) this means drink tea before we sleep and wake up to crumpets and jam. Unless you're up to no good spending some time at night developing with us, we highly suggest you should only help out if it's healthy for you before we call your mom to help you tuck bed.

But hey, we can work around this, we can give you enough information so that you can progress independently and separately

We're quite flexible with development, unlike other groups, as long you're working towards your end goal within a suitable timeframe, everything should be good. Don't be afraid to ask for changes in how you work.

If you have any issues concerning your tasks such as exams (please dont exploit this please dont exploit this please dont exploit this) DM us and we'll sort out what can be done.

### Watching
We're looking out for people who can do the following:
* Sinusoidal movement into cameras. To improve the current camera system (in the example above)
* Terrain creation.
* UV Mapping.
* SFX Management
* Testers/Suggesters

These are the main categories of members we're looking out for.

## Reimbursements
Reimbursements for large contributions towards the group are made based on self-amortization when the game is released and profittable, there will be rightfully equal shares. I personally just want to make a unique looking game :))

DM my ROBLOX account if you're up for the task or if you have any questions.
